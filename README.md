## About

Adds the ability for pickaxes to place light nodes. Configurable per player.


## Setup

Download mod, put in your `mods` or `worldmods` folder and enable it. You can also install it from the content tab in Minetest, or download it from [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/wsor4035/pick_axe_tweaks/).

If not using with Minetest Game, please change the default light node setting.

## Settings 

* `pat_light_node`: Default light node. (by default `default:torch`)

## API

For pickaxes, simply add the `pickaxe` group to the tool's groups, and it will automatically be registered.

Alternatively, for non-pickaxes, you can use the API function: `pick_axe_tweaks.register_tool(name)`
